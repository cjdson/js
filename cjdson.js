/*
  cjdson refers to a format popularized in the projectmeshnet community
  by the author of cjdns: Caleb James Delisle.

  It's just JSON, but with C style comments (line and block style).

  It's customary to call such a file .cjdson, since it isn't valid JSON.
  Your text editor likely won't recognize that file extension, though..
  By calling any such file *.json, your editor will likely
  highlight comments as errors. A true BUG||FEATURE situation.

  })
  .join("") // join to produce a monolithic string again
  .replace(/\/\*([\s\S]*?)\*\//g,"") // split multiline comments
